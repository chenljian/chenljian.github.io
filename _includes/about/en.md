Hello,  nice to meet you

I am Chen Liangjian, here is my blog

I will share my learning experience here

Including programing and daily life

Life is a kind of learning, is it?



I enter this field of computer by coincidence

Then I have learned a lot of fun from here

And write some interesting program

I like reading and swimming

Welcome!

——Chen Liang jian
